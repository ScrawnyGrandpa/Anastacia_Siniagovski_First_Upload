The project contains the main home page which was made for desktop, tablet and mobile.
The home page contains the sections: Nav, hero section, about me, project gallery (services), contact me and a footer with social media info and rights reserved mark.
In the project gallery you will find my current complete works, with a link to every project's own page. There you will find a download button and a view button. 
Each view project will open a new tab with the landing page for your viewing.

The project folders are split into 2 sections. Main folder and projects folder. Each container its corresponding images folder and style folder.
The script folders are currently empty because there is no JavaScript in the project yet.
